# Quickstart Guide


## IT things 

### Access to Infrastructure

Request access to SC [here](https://www.sc.uni-leipzig.de/).
You can then access the server from within the uni vpn. 


### Python Environment 

Install conda [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Then install and activate the environment so that you have all the required packages: 

```sh 
conda env create -f environment 

conda activate chess_ml
```


### Download and Preprocess Data

1. Download and unzip the data with: 

    ```sh
    mkdir data 
    cd data
    curl -L -o lichess-chess-puzzle-dataset.zip\
      https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/tianmin/lichess-chess-puzzle-dataset
    unzip lichess-chess-puzzle-dataset.zip
    ```

3. Preprocess the data 
    on you local machine you can run: 

    ```sh
    python -m chess_ml.data.transform \ 
           -i data/lichess_puzzle_transformed.csv \
           -o data/lichess_puzzle_labeled.csv
    ```

    if you are working on SC run: 

    ```sh
    sbatch ./sbatch-data-preparation.sh
    ```






## Library Usage  

There are two core components you will use for training models: Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 

### Imitation Learning 

You can either train a model locally with this: 

```sh
# get help and see parameters to change 
python -m chess_ml.train.imitation -h

# training a model 
python -m chess_ml.train.imitation 
```

Or you can run it on the slurm cluster 

```sh 
sbatch ./sbatch-training-imitation.sh
```



### Reinforcement Learning 

Again you can either train a model locally with this: 

```sh
# get help and see parameters to change 
python -m chess_ml.reinforcement.imitation -h

# training a model 
python -m chess_ml.train.reinforcement
```

Or you can run it on the slurm cluster 

```sh 
sbatch ./sbatch-training-reinforcement.sh
```


## Adjusting the Code

Not all parameters can be accessed from the cli, thus you may need to delve into the code. 
As a rule of thumb, those are the files and directories you may be interested in: 

- `./chess_ml/train/imitation.py`: all the parameters for imitation training are here
- `./chess_ml/train/reinforcement.py`: all the parameters for imitation training are here
- `./chess_ml/env/Rewards.py`: contains reward functions you can use for reference
- `./chess_ml/model/`: contains model implementations:
    1. `./chess_ml.model.Convolution.ChessCNN`: cnn class
    2. `./chess_ml.model.FeedForward.ChessFeedForward`: linear layer class
    3. `./chess_ml.model.ResBlock.ChessResBlock`: residual block class




## Environment and rewards

You can create a new environment with: 

```python
from chess_ml.env import Rewards
from  chess_ml.env.Environment import Environment

env = Environment(rewards=[...])
```

Where the reward parameter is a list of function names that should be evaluated at each step. 
The rewards functions are expected to have this function signature: 

```python 
def reward(state: chess.Board, move: chess.Move, result: chess.Board): -> float
    '''
    state : state of the board before the player moved 
    move  : move model suggested 
    result: state of teh board after the opponent player 
    '''
    return 0.0
```

The board is represented by with [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
Here is a quickguide, but feel free to look at the documentaion:

```python 
from chess import BLACK, WHITE, PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN, KING 
from chess import Board, Move
import chess

board = chess.Board()

# you can select squares
center = [chess.D4, chess.D5, chess.E4, chess.E5]

# you can get 
# this is either chess.BLACK or chess.WHITE
current_player = board.turn
```
