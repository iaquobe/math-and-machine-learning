# Get Started

1. download [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tianmin/lichess-chess-puzzle-dataset) to ./data/ 
2. unzip dataset to filename `./data/lichess-chess-puzzle-transformed.csv`
3. transform dataset with `python data/transform_data.py` (takes about ~20min)
4. train/test/save a model with `python -m chess_ml.train.Immitation` (takes more than ~20min)

# Study

Immitation, Immitation + RL, RL 
RL: 3-4 reward function sets? 

Training: 

- Immitation
- Immitation reward1
- Immitation reward2
- Immitation reward3
- Immitation reward4
- Reward1
- Reward2
- Reward3
- Reward4


Testing: 

1000 games against models and stockfish
